# CourseOutline
This is a program which uses a GUI to take user input and create a compiled, semester-long outline for the second CST term. It was created with a team of five over 12 hours at the BCIT Co-op Hackathon, January 2018.

Improvements:
- Being able to add and remove custom courses
- Having multiple ways to input calendar dates
- Functions for enter and tab keys

Design Dreams:
- Adding type of assignments: labs, quizzes, exams, assignments, readings to sort different ways
- Adding percentages and numbers of pages, to add detail

Lessons:
- Need to improve git collaboration and focus on workflow
- Good skeleton design at the beginning allows more room for improvement
